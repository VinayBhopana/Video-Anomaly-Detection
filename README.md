# ðŸŽ¥ Video Anomaly Detection using Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for detecting anomalies in surveillance videos using a **Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder**. The model is trained to reconstruct sequences of normal events, and any significant deviation in reconstruction error is flagged as anomalous.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify unusual or suspicious activity in video surveillance using reconstruction loss.
- **Approach**: Convert video into spatio-temporal cuboids and train an autoencoder to learn regular patterns.
- **Framework**: PyTorch-based implementation with preprocessing in OpenCV and FFmpeg.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: 3D convolution layers to encode spatial-temporal cuboids.
- **Decoder**: Mirrors the encoder to reconstruct the input sequence.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for reconstruction loss.
- **Anomaly Detection**: If reconstruction loss > threshold, frame is flagged as anomalous.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

### ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- FFmpeg
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

ðŸ“Š Output
Reconstruction loss is calculated per cuboid.

Frames with loss exceeding the threshold are flagged.

Plots and logs are saved for inspection.

âœ… Results
The model was able to detect anomalies with a sharp rise in reconstruction loss.

Normal activities were reconstructed well, while unusual frames showed high deviation.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Use ConvLSTM or 3D ResNet-based architecture for richer spatio-temporal modeling.

Apply frame-level heatmap overlays for better anomaly localization.

Integrate threshold tuning via validation ROC-AUC.
